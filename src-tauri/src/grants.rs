//! Paths the user has pointed the app at.
//!
//! A command that reads a local file (`scan_image`, `read_env_file`) gets its
//! path from the webview, and the webview's word is not authorization: a
//! script that got to run there could name any file on disk — another
//! project's `.env`, a photo in the user's library — and have the backend hand
//! it back. What the extension and shape checks in those commands decide is
//! *what kind of file* a path names, never *whether the user chose it*.
//!
//! Two events prove the user chose a file, and both reach Rust before the
//! webview ever sees the path: the OS file dialog, when it is opened from Rust
//! (`commands::tools::pick_file`), and a drop on the window, which the OS
//! delivers as a window event (`window::create`). Each grants the path here;
//! the reading command then has to `take` it. A path nobody granted is refused
//! however well it is named.
//!
//! A grant carries the purpose it was made for, because the framing the user
//! answered is part of what they agreed to. The env picker offers every file on
//! disk, the image picker only what the scanner opens; a path chosen from a
//! dialog that said "pick an environment file" was not offered up to be OCRed
//! for the card number or the passport fields in it. So the purpose is recorded
//! with the path and the reading command has to name the same one: a path
//! picked as an env file can only be read as one.
//!
//! Grants are one-shot — a take consumes them — and few: a bounded set, oldest
//! out, since a grant that was never read is a path the user pointed at and
//! then walked away from. Kept canonical so a grant cannot be sidestepped or
//! spent through a spelling of the path other than the one it was made under.
