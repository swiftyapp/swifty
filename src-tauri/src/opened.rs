//! Documents the OS asks the app to open: a double-clicked `.rowel` backup or
//! `.swftx` legacy vault, the two associations `tauri.conf.json` declares.
//!
//! The request arrives three ways. macOS delivers it as `RunEvent::Opened`,
//! whether Finder launched the app for it or the app was already running.
//! Windows and Linux put the path on the command line — of this process at
//! launch, or of the second instance the single-instance plugin folds into this
//! one. All three end in [`accept`].
//!
//! The webview may not be listening yet; at launch it never is. So the path is
//! parked in `AppState::pending_open` as well as announced as `file:opened`.
//! The frontend collects the parked one once it has subscribed
//! (`commands::app::take_opened_file`) and follows the event from then on, so
//! the two arrivals look the same to it.
