//! Credential sharing by link: seal one entry, park it in the sender's own
//! Drive for a day, hand out a link that carries the key.
//!
//! [`envelope`] holds the crypto and the link format, [`remote`] the Drive
//! folder. This module is the verb layer between them — create, open, revoke,
//! sweep, list — and it is generic over the two transport traits so the whole
//! lifecycle is testable without a network.
//!
//! The link is the only secret: it never reaches Drive, and nothing here stores
//! it. What Drive holds is ciphertext plus a handful of opaque properties,
//! which is also the only ledger of outstanding shares — any device holding the
//! vault that published one can therefore list, revoke and clean it up, and a
//! reinstall loses nothing.
