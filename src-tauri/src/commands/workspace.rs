//! Creating, restoring, switching, renaming and deleting workspaces.
//!
//! Only one workspace is ever unlocked, so every command here starts by
//! clearing the session: switching *is* locking what is open and pointing the
//! paths somewhere else. A switch therefore announces itself as the lock it is
//! (`vault:locked`), which is what re-probes `app_status` on the frontend;
//! creating one ends unlocked and has nothing to announce.
//!
//! A workspace can also arrive from Drive rather than be made here. That flow
//! borrows onboarding's keyless connect (`commands::setup`) wholesale — the
//! tokens it leaves pending, the probe, the events — and differs only in where
//! the restored vault lands and in what has to be put back when it fails. Or
//! it arrives from the account the open workspace already syncs to, with no
//! sign-in at all: every device connected to an account is meant to hold every
//! vault in it, so the account's other vaults are offered after each sync
//! (`sync::publish_remote_vaults`) and restored with the open workspace's own
//! tokens. A workspace *made* on a connected device inherits the account the
//! same way, and syncs to it as a vault of its own.
