//! Sync commands.
//!
//! Nothing here does the work: every command validates, starts a run, and
//! returns. The run itself lives on a thread of its own and reports through
//! `sync:status`. That split is the whole point of this rewrite — the first
//! Drive implementation drove Google's API from the command thread and froze
//! the window for the length of a round trip.
//!
//! The frontend never reconstructs sync state from a sequence of events: every
//! transition updates [`SyncRun`] and re-emits the whole [`SyncStatus`], which
//! the frontend stores as-is. One event, one shape, no order to agree on.
//!
//! Every run starts in [`start_run`], whichever command asked for it — a scheduled
//! sync, `sync_now`, or the run behind a connect. One launcher means one claim,
//! and one claim is what keeps two runs from addressing the account at the same
//! time.
//!
//! Connecting is not a run either. Every connect is keyless: the account is
//! asked what it holds first (`commands::setup::connect_pending`, the same
//! consent and probe onboarding runs), and only [`sync_adopt_pending`] seals
//! its tokens under the open vault — when the account is empty or already
//! holds this vault. An account holding other vaults is offered to restore
//! instead: every device connected to an account syncs the vaults it holds
//! rather than adding a pack beside them. The adoption is bound to the
//! workspace that started it: a switch during the probe is caught before the
//! tokens are sealed, never after.
