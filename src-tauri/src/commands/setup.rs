//! First-run onboarding: connecting Google Drive *before* a vault exists.
//!
//! Every other path through `sync` needs an unlocked session, because the OAuth
//! tokens live in a file sealed under the vault key. On a fresh install there is
//! no key and no vault, so the order has to be inverted: consent first, tokens
//! held in memory ([`AppState::pending_drive`]), and the account only written
//! down once the user's choice — restore what is up there, or start over — has
//! produced a key to seal it with.
//!
//! The connect step reports through events rather than its return value, so the
//! frontend can render "waiting for the browser" while the flow is out. Exactly
//! one of `setup:drive:probed` / `setup:drive:error` follows every
//! `setup:drive:pending` (see [`crate::events`]).
//!
//! That first half is not onboarding's alone. Adding a workspace by restoring
//! one of the account's other vaults has the same problem — a vault that does
//! not exist yet, so no key to seal an account under — and so borrows
//! [`connect_pending`], [`peek_pending`], [`download`] and
//! [`setup_drive_disconnect`] from here rather than copying them (see
//! `commands::workspace`). What that flow does *not* share is
//! [`guard_no_vault`], which is exactly the condition it inverts.
