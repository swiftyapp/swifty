//! Commands for one-time sharing. The logic is in [`crate::share`]; this is the
//! boundary that turns a session into the credentials a Drive call needs.
//!
//! Two rules shape every command here. The session lock is taken, read and
//! released before anything touches the network — a mutex held across an await
//! would stall every other command for a round trip. And the Drive work goes to
//! the blocking pool through [`super::blocking`], which is where the reasoning
//! for that lives.
