//! Bringing the account's other vaults onto this device without asking — when
//! the password that just opened a vault opens them too.
//!
//! Every device connected to an account is meant to hold every vault in it.
//! Settings › Workspaces offers the missing ones after each sync
//! (`sync::publish_remote_vaults`), but each has to be restored by hand with
//! its master password. Most people give their vaults one password, and for
//! them that prompt is a chore with one possible answer. So the moment a
//! password is in hand — a password unlock, a restore — it is tried against
//! the account's packs this device lacks, and the ones it opens become
//! workspaces here, beside the open one and without switching to it. A pack it
//! does not open is left where it was, for the Workspaces section to offer.
//!
//! The password outlives the command that had it by exactly the length of this
//! task: it is moved into a blocking-pool thread as a `Zeroizing<String>`,
//! spent on each candidate's Argon2id derive, and scrubbed when the thread
//! ends. It is never written anywhere. The task stops starting candidates once
//! [`JOIN_BUDGET`] has passed, so that length is the budget plus the one
//! download in flight when it ran out; whatever was not tried stays on offer.
//! Biometric unlock has a key and no password, so it cannot do this. See
//! docs/threat-model.md.
