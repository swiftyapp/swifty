//! Writing an export to wherever the user says, on two platforms that mean
//! opposite things by "save dialog".
//!
//! Desktop hands back a destination to write to. iOS has no such API: its only
//! export mechanism is "move this file to a place the user picks", so the
//! plugin fakes the desktop shape by creating an *empty* file in the app's
//! Documents directory and exporting that (`tauri-plugin-dialog` 2.7.2,
//! `ios/Sources/DialogPlugin.swift`: `saveFileDialog` at line 138 writes `""`
//! to `<Documents>/<fileName>` at lines 148-154, but only if nothing is there
//! yet, then hands that file to
//! `UIDocumentPickerViewController(url:in:.exportToService)` at line 168, which
//! copies it at pick time). The copy has therefore already happened by the time
//! the path comes back, so writing to it achieves nothing: on iOS the content
//! has to be in place *before* the dialog opens.
//!
//! Both callers (`vault::export_vault`, `import::export_entries`) go through
//! [`save_export`], so that ordering lives in exactly one place.
