//! The browser extension host.
//!
//! Rowel speaks the KeePassXC-Browser protocol, so the stock KeePassXC-Browser
//! extension fills logins from a Rowel vault with no extension code of our
//! own. The browser launches this binary as the extension's native messaging
//! host (`proxy`), which relays stdio to the running app over a local socket
//! (`server`); the app answers each request from the open vault (`actions`)
//! inside the protocol's sealed envelope (`protocol`). Browsers find the host
//! through the manifests `manifest` writes when the user turns this on.
//!
//! What the extension can reach is what the user could copy: the logins for
//! the site it is on, a TOTP code, a generated password, and the lock. An
//! extension gets in once per vault, by the user naming it in a dialog; after
//! that its identification key, kept inside that vault, is what it proves
//! itself with — to that vault, and to no other workspace on the device.
