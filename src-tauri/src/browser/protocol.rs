//! The wire half of the KeePassXC-Browser protocol: the key exchange, the
//! sealed envelope every later message travels in, and the refusals.
//!
//! The extension makes a fresh X25519 key pair per browser session and opens
//! with `change-public-keys`, the one message sent in the clear. Everything
//! after it is a NaCl box — XSalsa20-Poly1305 under the X25519 shared secret —
//! with a fresh 24-byte nonce per request; the reply is sealed under that
//! nonce plus one, which is also how the extension matches a reply to the
//! request it answers. A refusal is sent in the clear, as KeePassXC sends it:
//! `errorCode` a string of digits, `error` the English text.
