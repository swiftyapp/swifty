//! Google OAuth2 with PKCE (port of `gdrive/auth.js`), in two shapes.
//!
//! Desktop talks to a Desktop-app client: the consent URL opens in the browser
//! and a one-shot loopback listener on 127.0.0.1 captures the auth code, so the
//! whole flow is one blocking call. The listener takes whichever port the OS
//! hands it (Google allows any loopback port for a Desktop-app client) and
//! gives up after [`CONSENT_TIMEOUT`], so a consent tab the user closes
//! without answering cannot wedge a fixed port — or the "pending" state the
//! frontend shows — until the app restarts.
//!
//! iOS talks to an iOS client, which is public (no secret, PKCE mandatory) and
//! is registered against a redirect URI on its own URL scheme. Safari takes the
//! screen and the app is suspended behind it, so the flow has to be cut in half
//! — [`begin`] opens the consent page, [`complete`] runs when iOS reopens the
//! app with the redirect. Everything between the two (the PKCE pair, the auth
//! URL, the token exchange, the token file) is shared.
//!
//! Every request carries a random `state` that the redirect has to echo back
//! ([`parse_redirect`]). On desktop that is belt-and-braces over a loopback port
//! only this process listens on; on iOS it is the whole defence — any app can
//! open a URL on our scheme, and without the nonce one could pass off a stray
//! URL as Google's answer to a flow it never saw.
//!
//! Tokens are stored encrypted via the vault cryptor either way.
