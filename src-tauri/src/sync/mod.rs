//! Google Drive sync provider. Finds (or creates) `Rowel/Vaults/` and the
//! `<vault-id>.rowel` pack inside it, and reads/writes that one file. Every
//! name it uses comes from [`layout`].
//!
//! Which pack is *this* vault's is settled once per run, before the engine
//! starts: see [`resolve_vault_id`].
//!
//! The id that step settles on reaches the vault's `meta` table in the middle of
//! the run it was settled for (see [`run`]), never at either end: after the
//! remote pack has been fetched, decoded and merged — until then nothing has
//! proved it is this vault's — and before anything is packed or uploaded, so
//! Drive is never changed under an id this vault does not yet answer to.
//!
//! This module is only the *transport*: the sync algorithm lives in [`engine`],
//! behind the [`engine::Remote`] trait that [`DriveRemote`] implements. Drive's
//! REST calls are async and are driven with `block_on` here, which is safe
//! because a run always executes on its own thread (see `commands::sync`) —
//! never on a command thread, and never on a runtime worker.
