//! The shape of Rowel's footprint in a Google Drive account.
//!
//! ```text
//! Rowel/
//!   Vaults/
//!     <vault-id>.rowel     one pack per vault
//!   Shares/
//!     <random>.rowelshare              one outstanding share
//! ```
//!
//! Every folder name, file name and extension Drive ever sees is minted here,
//! so the sync engine, first-run onboarding and sharing cannot drift apart —
//! and so the local `.rowel` backup and the pack on Drive, which are the same
//! bytes, carry the same extension.
//!
//! A vault is addressed by its *vault id*: the identity of the data, stored in
//! the encrypted `meta` table (see [`crate::store::identity`]) and carried
//! inside every pack. It is deliberately not the local workspace id, which is
//! `default` on every install and cannot tell two devices' primaries apart.
//! The folder shows the opaque id and never the user's label for the vault.
//!
//! Pure: names in, names out. Nothing here talks to Drive.
