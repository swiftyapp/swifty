//! What a *keyless* install can ask of a connected Drive account.
//!
//! During first-run onboarding there is no vault, so none of the usual entry
//! points apply: [`super::run`] needs a session cryptor to read the token file
//! with, and the token file itself cannot exist until a vault key does. The
//! two questions onboarding actually has — which vaults are up there, give me
//! this one's bytes — are answered here against [`drive`] directly, with an
//! access token the caller holds in memory.
//!
//! (Not to be confused with [`super::setup`], the desktop consent flow for an
