//! The app-level unlock: every workspace's key, held once the app is open.
//!
//! One password, or one biometric prompt, opens the whole device. The primary
//! workspace's key is the *app key*: every other workspace keeps a copy of its
//! own key sealed under it, in a sidecar beside its database
//! ([`storage::WRAPPED_KEY_FILE`]), so opening the primary opens them all —
//! without an Argon2id run per workspace, and without a biometric prompt per
//! workspace. The sidecar is local to this device on purpose: the pack a
//! workspace syncs stays under its own password-derived key, so another device
//! restores it with a password exactly as before, and the app key differs from
//! device to device (each has its own primary and its own salt).
//!
//! What is held here is key *material* rather than a [`VaultKey`]: the same
//! opaque bytes the biometric store keeps, interpreted by sidecar presence when
//! a database is opened with them ([`VaultKey::from_material`]).
//!
//! The ring outlives a workspace switch — that is its whole point — and ends
//! with every lock (`session::lock`), the auto-lock included. It is filled by
//! whichever unlock happens first: a primary unlock unwraps every sidecar; a
//! non-primary unlock adds its own key, and writes its sidecar once the app key
//! is known ([`adopt`]).
