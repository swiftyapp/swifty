//! Website favicon fetch + cache, for list-row identity.
//!
//! Privacy: icons are fetched directly from the host an entry already points
//! at — never through a third-party favicon service — so the vault's host
//! list is not shipped anywhere new. Nor is it written anywhere new: the cache
//! is a table inside the open SQLCipher vault, so what it records — the hosts
//! looked up, and which of them have no icon — is encrypted at rest with the
//! rest of the vault's metadata rather than spelled out in file names beside
//! it. Misses are cached with a TTL so offline launches and dead hosts don't
//! retry on every run.
//!
//! The result crosses IPC as a `data:` URI, which keeps the webview CSP's
//! `img-src 'self' data:` intact. Remote SVG is refused outright — an SVG is
//! a script container, not an image.
//!
//! The host comes from an entry's URL, which is whatever was typed or imported,
//! so every request this module makes is a request the vault's contents can
//! aim. It may only aim at the public internet, and a name alone cannot say
//! where that is — `icons.example.com` may resolve to 127.0.0.1 — so each hop
//! (the page, every icon it names, every redirect) is resolved here, refused
//! unless every address is public, and connected to those very addresses. See
//! [`get`].
