// offering the way back.

// the chip's name and the biometric gate are both read off it, so they change
// in the one render that lands it. Meanwhile the switch is flagged, and the
// lock screen takes no attempt — the gate it still draws is the previous
// workspace's, and an unlock now would reach the next one. However it ends
// (opened, locked, refused), the switch probes once itself, so the flag never
// outlives it; a probe that fails leaves the safe default, no gate offered.
//
// One at a time. A second pick while the first is in flight is dropped rather
// than raced: the backend refuses it anyway, and its ending would clear the
// flag — and take attempts again — while the first was still landing.
