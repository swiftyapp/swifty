 * Every part below the nav row is the desktop's, unchanged — the whole block
 * under the header is literally `Show/Body`. What differs is where they are
 * placed and how much room they have: the scroller declares itself a
 * `@container`, and the rows fold themselves (see fields/Row).
 *
 * The reveal is the screen's, not this face's (`Compact/Entry`), so entering
 * and leaving edit never re-fetches the secrets.
