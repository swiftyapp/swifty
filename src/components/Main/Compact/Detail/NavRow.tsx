/**
 * The read screen's nav row: the way back on the left, one menu on the right,
 * no centred title — the entry names itself in the header below.
 *
 * The row used to carry the star and an Edit button too. Three controls in the
 * corner read as clutter beside the back control, so Edit went under the menu
 * (it is a step away, as iOS's own Edit often is) and the star moved down to
 * the entry's identity row, where it says what it is about — see `Read`.
 *
 * The back control carries the *previous* screen's name rather than the word
 * "Back", from the same hook the list root draws its title with, so the two can
 * never disagree about where this screen was pushed from.
