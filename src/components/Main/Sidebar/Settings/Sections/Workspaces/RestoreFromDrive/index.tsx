// Adding a workspace that already exists somewhere else.

// A second device can restore exactly one vault, during onboarding; every other
// vault in the same Google account was unreachable from it. This is the way in
// to those: the account is connected while a vault is open here, its tokens are
// held in memory, and the vault the user picks arrives as a workspace of its
// own — already syncing, since the account is sealed under its key on the way.
//
// Everything on screen follows the probe in the store, exactly as the first
// run's Drive screen does, and for the same reason: the answer arrives as an
// event, so a result that lands while the user is reading simply redraws this.

  // adopted by a later create or restore, so the pending tokens go with the
  // screen that asked for them — whether it goes because the user pressed
  // Cancel, moved to another section, or closed Settings. Harmless after a
  // restore that worked: the backend has already taken them. And harmless
  // during one: the backend holds the account for the restore's length and
  // refuses to drop it, so leaving mid-restore lets what the user asked for
  // finish — exactly as leaving mid-create does.
