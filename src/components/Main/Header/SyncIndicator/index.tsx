// the centre glyph never changes with status: position is one fact, progress is
// another, and swapping the glyph mid-run would conflate them.

          over a solid body, so its mass sits in its lower half and it reads
          about 2 viewBox units low. Beside it, an evenly weighted disk or cloud
          reads high. This nudges the pair back onto the lock's apparent centre
