/**
 * The first run, end to end.
 *
 * Screens are a stack rather than a graph: every one of them is reached from
 * exactly one place, so "back" is "pop" and no screen has to know who sent it.
 * The two screens with nothing behind them — the welcome, and the biometric
 * question once the session is already open — are the two that draw no Back,
 * which falls out of the stack being one deep rather than being decided again
 * per screen.
 *
 * The shell, the Back button and the mascot are drawn here, once, and stay
 * mounted from screen to screen: only the content under the mascot changes,
 * and it slides in from the side it came from — the right going forward, the
 * left coming back — while the mascot's smile eases to the new step's level.
 * Each screen is only its content.
 *
 * Nothing here enters the app until the very end: unlocking is not the last
 * step, enrolling a fingerprint is, and that can only be asked of an open
 * session.
