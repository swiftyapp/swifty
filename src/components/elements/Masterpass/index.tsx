// THE master-passphrase field, one presentation everywhere it is asked for —
// the lock screen, and the first run's create and restore screens — so the
// field the user meets on day one is the one they meet every day after. The
// real value and selection live in the input; mirrored copies drive the dot
// overlay. Masking is done with a text-transparent input + custom dots so the
// caret and letter spacing match the design in both themes. Because the
// input's own glyph geometry never matches the fixed cell grid, clicks are
// mapped to a character index against the drawn cells rather than left to the
// browser, and the overlay caret tracks the input's real selection so it
// always shows where the next edit lands.
//
// Deliberately unlike every other field in the app: a white card set gently
// into the window ground (see --lockfield-shadow) with big centered dots,
// whose border + halo carry the state — its own blue on focus (`lockfield`
// tokens, not the user's accent: this control's states are its character),
// red (plus a shake) on a bad passphrase, green while a successful unlock
// lands — while focus also cuts a touch deeper. Its only chrome is Touch ID (primary, when offered) and
// reveal (secondary, only once there is something to reveal) on the right
// edge. It fills its container: the caller decides how wide a card reads
// right on its screen.
