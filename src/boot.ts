 * the app off screen if it fails — a host without a backend still gets a lock
 * screen, which re-probes on its own (see `App.tsx`).
 *
 * The splash is not one of the gates. It is armed synchronously, the window is
 * revealed on the same tick, and React takes over whenever it is ready: the
 * lock screen draws the same mascot in the same pixels, so a handover
 * mid-choreography reads as a cross-fade rather than a cut.
