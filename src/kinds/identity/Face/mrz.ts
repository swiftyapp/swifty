 * ICAO 9303 defines two formats the documents in this vault use: TD3, the
 * passport's two lines of 44, and TD1, the three lines of 30 an ID card or a
 * residence permit carries. Both are the same fields laid out in fixed columns
 * with check digits over them, so the band is derived rather than stored —
 * nothing to fill in, and it stays true as the document is edited.
 *
 * A driving licence has no MRZ (it carries a barcode, which the face draws
 * instead) and `other` is not a format at all, so both get no band: `null`.
 *
 * The one liberty taken is the name. ICAO wants the primary identifier — the
 * surname — first, then `<<`, then the given names; the vault stores `name`
 * whole and deliberately, and guessing where to cut it is wrong for most of the
 * world. So the whole name goes in the name field, transliterated. A `surname`
 * row in `templates.ts` would make it exact.
