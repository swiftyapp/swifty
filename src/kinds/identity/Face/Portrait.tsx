// Where the photograph goes. The vault holds no photo, so the frame holds the
// silhouette every blank form prints there — shoulders cut by the frame's edge,
// as a passport photo is. It is what makes a face read as an ID at a glance
// rather than as a table of fields.
//
// A fraction of the document's own width, at the 3:4 a portrait photo is shot
// at, so it is the same size on the document however wide the pane is — which
// is how a photograph behaves on a card. Not a fraction of whatever height the
// fields came out at: the picture is part of the document, not a reaction to it.
//
// A little over a fifth, rather than the ~28% a passport and an ID-1 card both
// really use: on an ID-1 the number and the three-line machine-readable band
// want those millimetres more than the picture does, and a narrower photo also
// leaves the fields beside it wide enough to set in two lines instead of three.
